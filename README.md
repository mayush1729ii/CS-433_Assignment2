## Basic Setup
If you get any OpenFlow error:
* Run "sudo apt-get install openvswitch-testcontroller"
* Run "sudo cp /usr/bin/ovs-testcontroller /usr/bin/ovs-controller"
Our code already starts and ends "service openvswitch-switch", so no need to start it, instead start it again if you need it after our code has finished running.
Program related instructions are in the report itself.

## Part I: Implement the routing functionality in mininet.

## Part II: Throughput for different congestion control schemes.
Note: We plotted the graphs of the clients only and not stored the iperf bandwidth tables anywhere.
